What steps does Flipkart take to prevent card fraud?
Flipkart realizes the importance of a strong fraud detection and resolution capability. We and our online payments partners monitor transactions continuously for suspicious activity and flag potentially fraudulent transactions for manual verification by our team.

In the rarest of rare cases, when our team is unable to rule out the possibility of fraud categorically, the transaction is kept on hold, and the customer is requested to provide identity documents. The ID documents help us ensure that the purchases were indeed made by a genuine card holder. We apologise for any inconvenience that may be caused to customers and request them to bear with us in the larger interest of ensuring a safe and secure environment for online transactions.

What is a 3D Secure password?
The 3D Secure password is implemented by VISA and MasterCard in partnership with card issuing banks under the "Verified by VISA" and "Mastercard SecureCode" services, respectively.

The 3D Secure password adds an additional layer of security through identity verification for your online credit/debit card transactions. This password, which is created by you, is known only to you. This ensures that only you can use your card for online purchases.

How can I get the 3D Secure password for my credit/debit card?
